# Sidebar Role-Based Menu Implementation - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary of Changes:
The sidebar has been successfully configured to display different menus based on user roles:

### Role-Based Menu Structure:
1. **Admin Role**: Shows all menu items
   - Home, Dashboard, Akademik (Fakultas-Prodi, Dosen-Mooc, Studio-Matkul)
   - Kelola Booking (Acc Booking, Booking Jadwal)
   - Progres, Editor

2. **Mahasiswa & Dosen Roles**: Shows limited menu
   - Home, Dashboard, Booking Studio

3. **Editor Role**: Shows specific menu
   - Home, Dashboard, Progres, Editor

4. **Not Logged In**: Shows basic menu
   - Home, Dashboard

### Technical Changes Made:
- Fixed editor URL consistency: Changed from `progres/editor` to `editor` for both admin and editor roles
- Verified all menu items are correctly displayed based on user roles
- The sidebar now properly reads the logged-in user's role using `Auth::user()->role`

## Files Modified:
- `resources/views/layout/sidebar.blade.php` - Updated editor URLs for consistency

The sidebar is now ready for testing with different user roles.
